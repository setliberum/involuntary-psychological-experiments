Suicide in treatment - in psychotherapy in a hospitalized adolescent

Yoram Hazan

Adolescent Department of Eitanim Hospital

During psychoanalytic orientation therapy in the adolescent ward, a unique encounter occurred between a patient that in order to live had to feel death within the schizophrenic experience, and a therapist who in order to understand - had to experience the death of the patient - within the treatment.

Resuscitation of the patient's inner world and understanding of the forces at work through psychotherapy within the "therapeutic reality" of the ward is the basis for the treatment of psychoanalytic orientation in cases of profound disorders. This is a 17-year-old teenager who came to the ward following an attempted self-harm. The youngest son among 9 children, to an established family with many children from the south of the country. His older sister committed suicide when she was 18, he was then 4. The father's sister, died of a malignant disease at the same age (18) in the country of origin of the father. In his wallet, the father carries pictures of both. The daughter was named after his sister.

During the treatment, the crisis was restored, this time in response to the therapist's departure. We will summarize the main stages of treatment, and in detail the crisis point and turning point around the suicide attempt that occurred within the treatment. The possibility of understanding the move comes from the parallel occurrence in the ward staff - the therapist was “blamed” by the staff, as -did not- occurred in the original incident.

At the level of theory we learned from the treatment: a. On the similarities and differences between the case described by Freud (Schreiber) and the adolescent we treated. The basis for comparison is Berger's point of view which he saw in Schreiber's psychotic crisis, a necessary reconstruction of an aromatic past. B. From "Suicide in Treatment" it was possible to define what is happening to a therapist whose patient commits suicide inside treatment. We also referred to two rare articles discussing therapist responses in such cases (Bowen, Gorkin).

We will summarize the case from the question of the place of psychotherapy in similar cases of adolescents during a crisis, against the background of a deep disorder.
